6) Branding (Ghana Theme)
Inspired by the Ghana flag: red, gold, green, and black—adapted slightly for accessibility and modern UI.

Logo Concept (text description)
A simple “A” icon shape (for Accra) with subtle Ghana color bands (red/gold/green)
A small star motif (Ghana’s black star) as a mark of credibility
Wordmark: “Accra Chamber of Commerce”
Great for meeting the requirements needed for a commerce website 



7) Color Schema (Accessible Ghana Palette)
Core Palette (Hex)
These are theme-consistent and chosen for readable UI:

Primary (Forest Green): #0B3D2E
Secondary (Gold): #F2C400
Accent (Deep Red): #B10F1C
Neutral Dark (Charcoal): #111111
Neutral Light (Warm Off-White): #F7F5EF
Muted Border/Surface: #E6E1D6
Recommended Usage (to avoid “color mismatch” / low contrast)
Use these pairings for safe readability:

UI Element	Background	Text Color	Notes
Body text area	#F7F5EF	#111111	Very high contrast (safe default)
Header / footer	#0B3D2E	#FFFFFF	Strong readable branding
Primary button	#0B3D2E	#FFFFFF	CTA button
Primary button hover	#06261C	#FFFFFF	Darker hover
Secondary button	#F2C400	#111111	Gold with dark text (avoid white text here)
Accent banner	#B10F1C	#FFFFFF	Good for alerts/important CTA sections
Cards	#FFFFFF	#111111	Clean content blocks
Links (on light bg)	#0B3D2E	n/a	Underline for accessibility
Link hover	#B10F1C	n/a	Use underline + color change
Accessibility rule of thumb:

On gold backgrounds, use dark text (#111111), not white.
On green/red/dark backgrounds, use white text.
